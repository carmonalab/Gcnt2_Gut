# GCNT2 Expression Profiles in Human and Mouse Gut Resident T Cells 🧬

## Description ✅ <a name="description"></a> 

This project relies on scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq datasets from mouse and human guts to quantify _GCNT2_ expression across various cell types and distinct gastrointestinal conditions. 
The cellular focus of the analysis is CD8αα⁺ T cells (T⍺⍺) and CD8αβ⁺ tissue-resident memory T cells (Trm) although other gut resident cells are also investigated as a source of comparison.
Moreover, the study seeks to determine whether gastrointestinal conditions such as healthy, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), or celiac disease influence _GCNT2_ expression per cell type. 
It is also interesting to compare how conserved _GCNT2_ expression profiles are between human and mouse guts per cell type. Ultimately, this project will suggest potential immmunoregulatory roles
for _GCNT2_ and hopefully elucidate how T⍺⍺ cells are activated.
